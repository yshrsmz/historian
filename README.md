Historian is a custom [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber).Tree implementation that saves logs to SQLite, so that you can see/download the SQLite file later for debugging.

This library is primarily made to help debugging crash in consumers' devices.

## Installation

Historian is distributed via Maven Central. [![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/net.yslibrary.historian/historian-core/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/net.yslibrary.historian/historian-core)

```gradle
dependencies {
  compile 'net.yslibrary.historian:historian-core:LATEST_LIBRARY_VERSION'
  compile 'net.yslibrary.historian:historian-tree:LATEST_LIBRARY_VERSION'
  compile 'com.jakewharton.timber:timber:4.5.1'
}
```

## Usage

```java
class App extends Application {

    Historian historian;

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        historian = Historian.builder(context)
            // db name. defaults to "log.db"
            .name("log.db")
            // a directory where the db file will be saved. defaults to `context.getFiles()`.
            // The directory will be created if it does not exist.
            .directory(new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), "somedir"))
            // max number of logs stored in db. defaults to 500
            .size(500)
            // log level to save
            .logLevel(Log.INFO)
            .debug(true)
            .build();

        // initialize historian
        historian.initialize();

        Timber.plant(HistorianTree.with(historian));

        // delete all saved logs
        historian.delete();

        // provide db path in Uri
        historian.dbPath();
    }
}
```
